This application keeps tracks of the information in such a simple social network. More specifically, this application will allow for user profiles to be added to, deleted from, or looked-up in the social network. Moreover, for each profile, you will keep track of the person's name associated with that profile, an optional image that the person may wish to display with his/her profile, an optional "current status" for the profile (which is basically just a String indicating what activity the owner of that profile is currently engaged in), and a list of friends for each profile.
